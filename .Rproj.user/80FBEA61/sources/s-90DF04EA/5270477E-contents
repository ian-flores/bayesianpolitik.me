I scraped all the historical data from the Puerto Rico's Electoral Commission webpage to make it accesible in a way that can be combined with Census data, as well as other socio-economic indicators to better explain political patterns in Puerto Rico. In the next month I will add as well the elections of 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, but with a more granual level than municipalities. I parsed the names of the parties I knew, but the other ones stayed with the code assigned by the CEE, if you know them, and can provide a reference please send me an email at: <iflores.siaca@gmail.com>

> The GitHub repository with all the code for this project is available here: <https://github.com/ian-flores/PR_Elections_Historical_Data>
