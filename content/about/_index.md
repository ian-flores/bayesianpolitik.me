I am a Data Scientist with vast experience working with government agencies, NGO's and educational institutions in Puerto Rico, the United States and Canada. My main focuses are data science education, data infrastructure, data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, graph theory and bayesian statistics.

## What do I do?

I am an applied scientist who is trying to use algorithms, statistics and data to understand problems and situations that occur in our world. One example of this is my Master's final project with RStudio. In collaboration with Juno Chen, Rayce Rossum, and Richard Zitomer and under the guidance of Dr. Tiffany Timbers, we studied how people use the Version Control System, Git. To do this we used graph theory and machine learning methods to extract common sub-patterns in the way people collaborate together.

In an effort of total transparency, I have requested the Office of the Comptroller of the Government of Puerto Rico to publish the four (4) contracts I have had with the Government of Puerto Rico in their full version. These are available [here](https://consultacontratos.ocpr.gov.pr/), if you type `Ian Flores` under the `Contratista` text box you will see the contracts listed. Under the `Documento` column you can find the PDF of the full contract minus personal information.
