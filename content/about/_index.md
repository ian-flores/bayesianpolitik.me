I am currently a Master of Data Science student at the University 
of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I hold a 
Bachelor in Science with a major in Integrative Biology from the University
of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras Campus. I have a special interest for the 
intersection of Data Science, Cyber Security and Politics.

## What do I do?

I am an applied scientist who is trying to use algorithms, statistics and data to understand problems and situations that occur in our world. One example of this is my current capstone project with RStudio as part of my Masters'. In collaboration with Juno Chen, Rayce Rossum, and Richard Zitomer and under the guidance of Dr. Tiffany Timbers, we are studying how people use the Version Control System, Git. To do this we are using graph theory and machine learning methods to extract common sub-patterns in the way people collaborate together.

## Work Experience

* University of British Columbia -  Department of Statistics - [Course Materials](https://github.com/ubc-dsci/dsci-100)
    * Develop educational material for the Introduction to Data Science course (DSCI 100)
    * Contribute to the development of new tools for education using reproducible workflows
* Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics - [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ian-flores/TransparenciaFinanciera)
    * Developed an open source application to visualize financial data from the Government of Puerto Rico.
* Caras de las Americas - [Deployed App](https://server.connectrelief.com/)
    * Develop web application to visualize data from surveys realized in communities in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.
* Puerto Rico Violent Death Reporting System
    * Completed the data services infrastructure of the Puerto Rico Violent Death Reporting System.
* National Ecological Observatory Network - [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ian-flores/NEON-2016-Internship-DPS)
    * Developed an open source application to visualize the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of
animals in the continental United States.
    * Investigated the use of visualizations to make science more accessible to non-scientific users.
      
In an effort of total transparency, I have requested the Office of the Comptroller of the Government of Puerto Rico to publish the four (4) contracts I have had with the Government of Puerto Rico in their full version. These are available [here](https://consultacontratos.ocpr.gov.pr/), if you type `Ian Flores` under the `Contratista` text box you will see the contracts listed. Under the `Documento` column you can find the PDF of the full contract minus personal information.

## Research Experience

* University of Puerto Rico - Department of Computer Science
    * Applied Convolutional Neural Networks to classify animal callings in audio recordings.
    * Devised data augmentation techniques for images of the callings to lower the validation error of classification algorithms.
* University of Puerto Rico - Department of Biology
    * Analyzed the spatial distribution of malaria in lizards in a secondary forest in Puerto Rico.
    * Implemented regression methods to explain the distribution of the disease.
