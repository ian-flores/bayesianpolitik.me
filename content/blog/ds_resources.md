This is a list I compiled of my favorite Data Science resources that are useful to get started on the field.

## R

### R for Data Science - https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ 

> “This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.”

### Hands-On Programming with R - https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/

> “This book will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples. I wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. You’ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R’s environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R’s programming tools. Throughout the book, you’ll use your newfound skills to solve practical data science problems.”

## Python

### Think Python - https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/

> “Think Python is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters.”

### Python Data Science Handbook - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/

> “The book is not meant to be an introduction to Python or to programming in general; I assume the reader has familiarity with the Python language, including defining functions, assigning variables, calling methods of objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks. Instead it is meant to help Python users learn to use Python's data science stack–libraries such as IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related tools–to effectively store, manipulate, and gain insight from data.”

## Machine Learning

### Theory:

#### Machine Learning 101 

Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kSuQyW5DTnkVaZEjGYCkfOxvzCqGEFzWBy4e9Uedd9k/present?slide=id.g168a3288f7_0_58

#### Metacademy: Machine Learning - https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/cjrd/coursera_ml_supplement

> “This roadmap is a supplement to Andrew Ng's Coursera machine learning course. You should use this roadmap to review the essential concepts presented during each section, find detailed resources for each of the discussed concepts, and also to brush up on necessary prerequisite concepts for the covered material (especially if you'd like to learn the concepts in greater detail). This roadmap is a work in progress, but you may still find it useful in its current incarnation.”

#### A visual introduction to machine learning - http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/

> “In machine learning, computers apply statistical learning techniques to automatically identify patterns in data. These techniques can be used to make highly accurate predictions. Keep scrolling. Using a data set about homes, we will create a machine learning model to distinguish homes in New York from homes in San Francisco.“

### Practical

#### Machine Learning Exercises in Python - https://www.johnwittenauer.net/machine-learning-exercises-in-python-part-1/

> “This blog post will be the first in a series covering the programming exercises from Andrew's class. One aspect of the course that I didn't particularly care for was the use of Octave for assignments. Although Octave/Matlab is a fine platform, most real-world "data science" is done in either R or Python (certainly there are other languages and tools being used, but these two are unquestionably at the top of the list). Since I'm trying to develop my Python skills, I decided to start working through the exercises from scratch in Python. The full source code is available at my IPython repo on Github. You'll also find the data used in these exercises and the original exercise PDFs in sub-folders off the root directory if you're interested.”

#### Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow - https://icenamor.github.io/files/books/Hands-on-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-2E.pdf

> “This book assumes that you know close to nothing about Machine Learning. Its goalis to give you the concepts, the intuitions, and the tools you need to actually imple‐ment programs capable of learning from data.We will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonlyused (such as linear regression) to some of the Deep Learning techniques that regu‐larly win competitions.Rather than implementing our own toy versions of each algorithm, we will be usingactual production-ready Python frameworks”

## Statistics

### Statistical Inference via Data Science - https://moderndive.com/

> “This book assumes no prerequisites: no algebra, no calculus, and no prior programming/coding experience. This is intended to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would.”

### Seeing Theory - https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/

> “Seeing Theory was created by Daniel Kunin while an undergraduate at Brown University. The goal of this website is to make statistics more accessible through interactive visualizations (designed using Mike Bostock’s JavaScript library D3.js).”

### OpenIntro Statistics - https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics

> “OpenIntro Statistics offers a traditional introduction to statistics at the college level. This textbook is widely used at the college level and offers an exceptional and accessible introduction for students from community colleges to the Ivy League. The textbook has been thoroughly vetted with an estimated 20,000 students using it annually.”
