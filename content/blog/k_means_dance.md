Dancing can be traced back to the origins of almost every society in the world. It is a way to communicate ideas and feelings in a free manner. *[I would add something here about how dance is a simple, memorable and effective way to communicate? Maybe give an example of children's dance songs in an educational/story telling context?]* We wondered whether we could use dance to facilitate student learning and retention of a Machine Learning algorithm in an introductory data science course. For this activity we wanted to involve students
to be part of the process of the algorithm. To do this we used interpreative dance as part of active learning, which has been shown that helps improve the students' perception of the learning material (Detlor et.al. 2012) and performance (Anderson et. al. 2005). (For a more complete treatment of resources on Active Learning look at:

For this lecture in particular we wanted to showcase how the K-Means clustering algorithm works, from initialization to convergence. K-means is an algorithm that tries to find sub-groups within data sets in an unsupervised manner, using the similarity of observations to group them instead of using class labels. *[You might need to write the algorithm here so people not familiar with it can follow the rest of the post]*

To do this in the classroom we had the students act as data points and the Teaching Assistant's (TA's) as centroids. To start the activity we gave the students 3 different coloured sticky notes matching the TA' shirt colours. Then the TA's randomly positioned themselves in the classroom and the students discussed which TA was closer to them. Based on this, they assigned themselves the labels of the cluster to which they decided they belong by raising the sticky note of the corresponding colour to match the centroid colour. Once all of the students had assigned themselves,
the TA's moved to the center of the new clusters. We repeated the process until the
students agreed that the algorithm had converged (that the TA's didn't had to move more).

We received postitive feedback from the students that this class activity helped them learn and remember the K-means algorithm  *[I added this without know if its true, it it's not, please remove but write some other positive statement about the experience here]* One of the limitations to this class activity that we observed was that the algorithm converges very quickly given the students engagement and attention to detail.

All educators, including Data science educators, should be looking to acquire new teaching techniques that are engaging to help students learn complex concepts. We believe that interpretive dance is a great tool for the data science educator's toolbox for teaching the K-means, and potentially, other algorithm(s).
