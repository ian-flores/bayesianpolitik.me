## Current Research Project

#### Deep Learning and Data Augmentation

> Project with Dr. Carlos Corrada

Data augmentation techniques to overcome the barrier posed by deep learning methods which require big amounts of data to achieve a high accuracy for classification purposes. We are using a biological dataset collected from soundscape recordings in forests in Puerto Rico as a model to explore these methods.

## Current Personal Projects
